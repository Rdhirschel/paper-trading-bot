# Paper Trading Bot

The Paper Trading Bot is a project that simulates trading with real-time stock data. It leverages the Alpaca API for trading and retrieves historical data for analysis.

## Key Features
- Monitor your cash balance and track your trading performance.
- Visualize your cash balance in real-time.
- Log your trading activities for review and analysis.

## Disclaimer
- Please note that the current state of this trading bot is primarily for learning purposes.
- Use at your own risk.
- At it's current state, this trading bot, for a lack of a better word, sucks.
- It is designed to trade with paper money rather than real funds. 

In the future, I may consider training a machine learning model to make informed investment decisions.
